# Weather Dashboard
This application allows the user to search by city name to find out the current weather and the five-day forecast for that city.

## Description
When users upload the page for the first time it will be presented with a blank page with a city search input field on the side.

When user enter an existing city name and press the search button, the page is populated with the searched city current weather, and a five-day forecast. The current weather information includes the city name, date, icon representing the weather, temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index. The UV index has been color coded in accordance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

Index Level color code:
* Green - 1 and 2
* Yellow - 3 through 5
* Orange - 6 and 7
* Red - 8 through 10
* Purple - 11 and greater

When a city weather is presented it also creates a button with that city name, which gives the option for the user to click on the different previously searched city, eliminating the need to type the name again. In case users type and search for a city that already has a button, another button is not created.

When users refresh the page the last search city is populated in the page. The buttons for all previously researched button remain.

Users can clean all the previous searched cities, deleting all buttons, clicking on the button "Clean Previous Search".
